        <h1>Jake's Website</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Jake, and I am currently a senior majoring in Management Information Systems (MIS) at the University of Oklahoma.</p>
        <p>I have a strong passion for banking and finance, and I enjoy working with numbers and collaborating with teams to solve complex problems. I have experience in programming languages like C# and Python, and I have worked on various projects involving databases and software development.</p>
        <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable work experience as a lifeguard at Westwood Waterpark and my local city pool in Lawton. These roles taught me responsibility, teamwork, and the importance of staying calm under pressure.</p>
        <p>Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my skills, projects, and professional journey!</p>
